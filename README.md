Cybersecurity Incident Response Using Splunk

Splunk is a powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool used for real-time security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. It helps SOC analysts analyze logs, detect anomalies, and automate responses.

Incident Response Workflow with Splunk:
Log Collection & Monitoring – Splunk ingests logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoints, and network devices.

Threat Detection – Correlation searches, alerts, and dashboards help identify suspicious activities.

Investigation – Analysts use Splunk’s search queries (SPL) to analyze logs and find Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

Response & Mitigation – Automated playbooks (Splunk SOAR) can isolate infected systems, block malicious IPs, and notify stakeholders.

Post-Incident Review – Reports and logs help improve security policies and prevent future attacks.

Splunk enhances incident response by providing real-time visibility, automation, and threat intelligence, making it a key tool in cybersecurity operations.
